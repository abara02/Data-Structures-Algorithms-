# Data Structures & Algorithms
Part of my DSA portfolio: a collection of simple Java programs demonstrating fundamental Data Structures & Algorithms skills, 
along with basic Java programming skills.



## Files
- [`TopScores.java`](TopScores.java) — A simple program to display the top 15 scores from a given array, utilizing a doubly linked list and the implementation of add and remove methods
- [`SortingTests.java`](SortingTests.java) — A simple program that implements Insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, and merge sort runs tests on random and almost sorted arrays and compares benchmark times in ms.
- [`DoublestackADT.java`](DoublestackADT.java) - A simple program implementing a two-color stack ADT using a single array, supporting red and blue stacks with color-specific push, pop, and peek operations.
- [`ExpressionTreeTest.java`](ExpressionTreeTest.java) - A simple program that converts a fully parenthesized arithmetic expression into a binary expression tree, displays the tree, evaluates the value of the root, and allows interactive updates of variables stored at the leaves.

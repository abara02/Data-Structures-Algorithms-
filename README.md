# Data Structures & Algorithms
Part of my DSA portfolio: a collection of simple Java programs demonstrating fundamental Data Structures & Algorithms skills, 
along with basic Java programming skills.



## Files
- [`TopScores.java`](TopScores.java) — A simple program to display the top 15 scores from a given array, utilizing a doubly linked list and the implementation of add and remove methods
- [`SortingTests.java`](SortingTests.java) — A simple program that implements Insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, and merge sort runs tests on random and almost sorted arrays and compares benchmark times in ms
- [`DoublestackADT.java`](DoublestackADT.java) - A simple program implementing a two-color stack ADT using a single array, supporting red and blue stacks with color-specific push, pop, and peek operations
- [`ExpressionTreeTest.java`](ExpressionTreeTest.java) - A simple program that builds a binary expression tree from a fully parenthesized arithmetic expression, evaluates the expression using variable values stored in a map, and allows you to update variables to recompute the result
- [`Graph.java`](Graph.java) - A simple program implementing a generic graph ADT using an adjacency matrix structure. Supports adding and removing vertices and edges, labeling edges, and printing the matrix
- [`MainAdjacency.java`](MainAdjacency.java) - A simple program implementing a generic graph ADT using an adjacency list structure. Supports adding and removing vertices and edges, and printing the graph
